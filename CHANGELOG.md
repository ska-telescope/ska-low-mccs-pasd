## 3.2.0

* [THORN-142] Incorporate status registers and FEM breaker trips into healthState.

## 3.1.3

* [THORN-220] Update dependencies, add cleanup methods for component managers and proxies.

## 3.1.2

* [THORN-225] Fix health rediscovery after adminMode cycle.

## 3.1.1

* [THORN-212] Add tests for fieldStation health aggregation and reconfigure.
* [THORN-71] Update PASD to include command schemas in docs

## 3.1.0
* [THORN-212] Allow fieldStation healthThresholds to be reconfigurable.

## 3.0.1
* [SKB-876] Fix strategy for re-requesting 'read once' attributes if the h/w is unavailable at startup.

## 3.0.0

* [THORN-129] Make pytest pipeline parallel
* [SKB-455] Add delay before reconnecting after failed poll.
* [LOW-1296] Breaking changes to helm chart values schema.
  The `ska-low-mccs-pasd` helm chart now uses `ska-tango-devices`
  to configure and deploy its Tango devices.
  For details, see the "Direct deployment of helm charts" section of the
  "Deploying" page in the documentation.

## 2.0.0

* [THORN-136] Refactor port configuration to be deploy-time instead of run-time. The PaSD configuration server has been removed, and has instead been replaced with 4 device properties to be populated at deployment: MccsFNDH.PortsWithSmartbox, MccsSmartbox.FndhPort, MccsSmartbox.PortsWithAntennas, MccsSmartbox.AntennaNames.
* [THORN-139] Add Fieldstation docs.

## 1.1.1

* Update ska-tango-base 1.3.1 -> 1.3.2 (https://gitlab.com/ska-telescope/ska-tango-base/-/releases)
* [THORN-121] Add deploy stage to pipeline.
* [THORN-116] Prune log messages.

## 1.1.0

* [THORN-86] FieldStation now uses the CommunicationManager from ska-low-mccs-common to manage it's communication status, this should flush out issues with rapid changes of adminmode.
* [THORN-85] Update devices to serialise their events through the EventSerialiser. This should have no operational
changes, but an attribute EventHistory is now available on all devices to debug which events this device received,
where they came from, the order they came in, and what callbacks were executed with those events. It is a json-ified list of lists.
