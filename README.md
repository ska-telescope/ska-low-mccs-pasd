SKA-Low-MCCS-PaSD
=================

This project is developing the Local Monitoring and Control (LMC) software for the Power and Signal Distribution (PaSD) components of the
[Square Kilometre Array](https://skatelescope.org/) Low telescope.

It provides a number of Tango devices for controlling the hardware via a Python Modbus interface, and a top-level Fieldstation device. It
also provides a simulation of the hardware for the purposes of automated testing.
